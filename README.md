# Spotify Track Analysis(Python + SQL)

## Overview:
Music has always been a personal passion of mine. I believe it holds the unique power to uplift spirits, offer emotional healing, and motivate people. As the world's largest music streaming platform, Spotify provides a vast and insightful dataset that enables us to explore which types of music resonate most with listeners around the globe. In this project, I analyze Spotify track data using Python, SQLite (SQL), and various data visualization tools. By comparing tracks with high and low popularity, the objective is to uncover which characteristics， such as tempo, energy, loudness, or danceability, contribute most to a song’s success on Spotify.
