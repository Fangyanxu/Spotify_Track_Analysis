# Spotify Track Analysis(Python + SQL)

## Overview:
Music has always been a personal passion of mine. I believe it holds the unique power to uplift spirits, offer emotional healing, and motivate people. As the world's largest music streaming platform, Spotify provides a vast and insightful dataset that enables us to explore which types of music resonate most with listeners around the globe. In this project, I analyze Spotify track data using Python, SQLite (SQL), and various data visualization tools. By comparing tracks with high and low popularity, the objective is to uncover which characteristics such as tempo, energy, loudness, or danceability, contribute most to a songâ€™s success on Spotify.

## Tools:
- **Python**: Data manipulation and visualization  
- **Pandas / NumPy**: Data cleaning and transformation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visual analytics  
- **Scikit-learn**: K-Means clustering, PCA, Silhouette scoring  
- **SQLite3**: SQL queries for fast filtering and aggregation  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For iterative development and visualization 

## Key Findings:
1. Which artist has the most top-performing songs?
2. What is the average stream count per genre? Which genre has the highest total number of streams?
3. How do tempo, energy, and danceability differ between high and low popularity tracks?
4. What is the correlation between loudness and popularity across different popularity levels?
5. How does genre distribution vary between high and low popularity tracks?
6. Top 20 artists over time?
